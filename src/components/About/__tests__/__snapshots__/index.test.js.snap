      About
    </h1>
    <p>
      Cats. I've got 'em, and the internet loves 'em—cats in general, I mean, but also my cats. Well, 
      <i>
        our
      </i>
       cats. They're not just mine. My wife would tell you Rhaegar is her cat and Hashtag is my cat, but she's mostly teasing. Mostly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though if we're honest, that's probably what the cats would tell you, too. They've got favorites and so do we. Let's not pretend otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, aside from showing off photos of cats, this site is for showing off my skills in the realm of ⚛️ React, 🧪 test-driven development, and 📄 single-page application development.

      So take a look around using 
      <a
        href="#navbar"
      >
        the navbar
      </a>
      , or jump straight to 
      <a
        href="https://github.com/rrcampbell-exe/photo-portfolio"
        rel="noreferrer"
        target="_blank"
      >
        the GitHub repo
      </a>
       for this app. It's not like the cats will bite you either way. Probably.
