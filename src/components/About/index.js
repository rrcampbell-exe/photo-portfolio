      <p>Cats. I've got 'em, and the internet loves photos of 'emâ€”cats in general, I mean, but also my cats. Well, <i>our</i> cats. They're not just mine. My wife would tell you Rhaegar is her cat and Hashtag is my cat, but she's mostly just teasing. Mostly.</p>
      <p>Honestly, that's probably what the cats would tell you, too. They've got favorites and so do we. Let's not pretend otherwise.</p>
      <p>Anyway, aside from showing off photos of *ahem* <i>our</i> cats, this site is for showing off <i>my</i> skills in the realm of React, test-driven development, and developing single-page applications.</p>
      <p>So take a look around using <a href="#navbar">the navbar</a> up top, or jump straight to <a href="https://github.com/rrcampbell-exe/photo-portfolio" target="_blank">the GitHub repo</a> for this app. It's not like the cats will bite you either way. Probably.</p>
